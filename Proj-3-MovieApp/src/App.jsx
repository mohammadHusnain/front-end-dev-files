// when a state change occurs , the entire components is reran or re-rendered, if we dont define states in react the entire data will be vanished on re render and wont update dynamically and should be written from scratch. State in React is like a memory for your components. It lets them remember information and keep track of changes over time. Without state, your components would be "static" (unchanging), like a printed photoâ€”it just shows the same thing forever.

import React from 'react'
import MovieCard from './components/MovieCard'

  // const movienumber = 3;

  return (

          (<MovieCard movie={{ title: "squid game", release_date: "2025", }} /> )} */}
