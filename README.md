This repository represents my systematic progression through core frontend technologies, from foundational web development concepts to modern JavaScript frameworks. The collection demonstrates hands-on experience with:

HTML5 semantic markup and document structure.

CSS3 including Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design principles.

Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling workflows.

JavaScript (ES6+) covering DOM manipulation, async programming, and modern syntax.

React.js fundamentals including components, hooks, state management, and routing.
